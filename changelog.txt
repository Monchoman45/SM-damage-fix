Short changelog:
  * Compared to vanilla, all guns receive a small effective damage buff (~7%, varies by weapon)
  * Effects:
    * Shields are weak to EM
    * Armor is weak to heat
    * Systems are weak to kinetic
    * Default cannons deal 15% more than listed damage to systems, exactly listed
      damage to shields and 15% less than listed damage to armor
    * Default beams deal 15% more than listed damage to shields, exactly listed
      damage to armor and 15% less than listed damage to systems
    * Default missiles deal 15% more than listed damage to armor, exactly listed
      damage to systems and 15% less than listed damage to shields
    * Linking a maxed effect computer to your gun will make it do its maximum
      possible damage against the target that is weak to that effect, but will
      reduce your damage against both other targets
      * Example: adding a maxed EM computer to a missile will give you the most
        posible damage vs. shields, but will reduce your damage vs. armor and systems
      * See tables printed above or use effect_tables.py
    * Effects are calculated before armor is, meaning heat effect will improve
      your armor penetration and heat resistance will decrease your opponent's
      armor penetration
  * Hull now counts as armor but still does not benefit from armor stacking
    * Hull is weak to heat like standard and advanced armor
  * Defense chamber armor tree is now the defense chamber resistance tree
    * Buffs apply to all damage received, not just damage received on armor
      * This makes the kinetic and EM nodes worth getting if you plan on
        tanking with systems(???) or shields
    * Base node provides 5% resistance to all effects
      * Effect specific nodes grant 10% each, for a maximum total of 25%
      * Adopting the entire tree will grant a flat 25% damage reduction
        in all situations
  * Base missile (with no slave) is now a lock on instead of dumbfire
    * This still isn't configurable but can be changed with minimal code work
  * Fixed bugs:
    * Effects now actually mod
    * Cannons no longer destroy infinite hull blocks with 1 bullet
    * Defense chamber armor tree now actually provides a buff instead of
      just eating your precious RC
    * Beams now actually gain dps from effect modules instead of lying to you
    * Effect computers no longer need to be relinked to apply spread changes
      every time the entity is loaded
    * AI will no longer lead their beam shots
    * 32 block armor cap has been increased to 100 and is now configurable in
      blockBehaviorConfig as ArmorRaycastLength
      * This is also now standardized between both beams and cannons, where
        previously only cannons were affected by the cap and beams would count
        much more armor
  * Known bugs:
    * Defense chamber resistance tree base node says it gives you 105% resistance
      to everything (visual only)
    * The last bullet or damage tick to break a shield may not deal proper damage
      to the blocks beneath it
    * Red damage numbers from sun damage do not account for your environmental
      resistance, and you will still receive a warning even if you have 100%
      resistance (visual only)
    * Beams sometimes do double the number of damage ticks they're supposed to
  * Still planned:
    * Acid should be looked at in depth
    * Missiles haven't been touched yet
      * Shouldn't ignore armor
      * Should actually deal their listed damage instead of just making everything up
    * Effects should apply before shield defense chambers (they might already, haven't
      checked)
